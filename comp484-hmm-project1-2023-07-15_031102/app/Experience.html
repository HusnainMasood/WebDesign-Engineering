<h3>Web Programming</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
   I have a lot of experience with web programming. I know how to use HTML and CSS. 
   Also I know how to use JavaScript. I might know other programming languages for
   web progamming but HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three main languages I know.</p>

<aside role="complementary">
<h3>C/C++ Programming</h3>
<!-- The sup tag is a superscript text. I am using it as footnotes for referencing. -->
<p dir="ltr">
   I mostly have a background in C/C++ programming. In fact, C/C++ was my first programming 
   language I learned before learned other ones. C/C++ can be used for web development in 
  what is called Common Gateway Interface.<sup><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_web_programming.htm" title="1"      target="_blank">1</a></sup></p>
</aside>
<aside role="complementary">
<h3>Python Programming</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
   Another programming language I have experience with is Python. Like C/C++, I mostly
   have experience with Python. Python can also be used for web development.<sup><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_web_development_libraries/index.htm" title="1" target="_blank">2</a></sup> </p>

<!-- The dfn tag is short for "definition element", and it specifies a term being defined in the content.
     I am using it to define computer architecture, organization, operating systems, and networking.-->
<aside role="complementary">
<h3>Computer Architecture and Organization</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
   I know what computer architecture and organization is. A <dfn>computer architecture</dfn>
   is implementing the different parts of a computer. A <dfn>computer organization</dfn>
   is after the decision of the architecture. I have learned about it when I was doing my bachelor's degree in computer science. </p>
</aside>
<aside role="complementary">
<h3>Operating Systems</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
   Also, I know what operating systems are. An <dfn>operating system</dfn> is a software that maintains computer hardware. Its a program that runs all the time on the computer. Also I have learned about it when I was doing my bachelor's degree in computer science.</p>
</aside>
<aside role="complementary">
<h3>Networking</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
   And I also have experience with networking. A <dfn>network</dfn> is a system that connects many computers to share data. I have learned networking when I was doing my bachelor's degree.</p>
